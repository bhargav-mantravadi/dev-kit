#one-liner command in bash to find which subdirectory (recursively) has the maximum number of files:
find . -type f -printf '%h\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -1
find . -type f -printf '%h\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

count files in the current directory
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l

search recursively for a filename
grep -r -i copy-filess.sh

recursive partial-name search
find linux -type f -iname "*copy-filess*"

for absolute path
find "$(realpath .)" -type f -iname "copy-files.sh"

To list directories with their sizes in descending order:
du -sh */ | sort -hr
